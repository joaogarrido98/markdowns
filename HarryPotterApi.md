This project was made with the intention of learning how to create RESTApi's and it's based on the characters created by J.K.Rowling.

# Usage

This is a step by step of how to use the API

The api consists of a number of endpoints that are called through any language.

I will use javascript to show how the data can be used.

## Endpoints

All endpoints have the following pre url : TO BE INPUTED

`GET` **Characters**
